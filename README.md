**Why this project?**

Moody is a personal project that was developed as part of my training at the Wild Code School in Bordeaux. As a student, I wanted to improve my web design skills and gain more experience with front-end development. Moody provided the perfect opportunity to do so, as it allowed me to practice Github, designing a user interface and implementing it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overall, Moody was a challenging and rewarding project that allowed me to grow as a web designer and front-end developer.

**Design: Figma**

Figma is a cloud-based design tool that allows designers to create, collaborate, and share designs in real-time. It was used to design the user interface and experience for Moody, from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups.

**Typography: Bergen Text**

Bergen Text is a free serif typeface designed by Andreas Leonidou. It was chosen for its clean and modern look, as well as its readability on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Front-end Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to build the front-end of the Moody app. HTML provided the structure and content of the app, CSS was used for styling and layout, and JavaScript was used to add interactivity and functionality to the app.
Overall, this stack allowed for a clean and modern design, with a focus on usability and functionality. By using Figma for the design process and Bergen Text for typography, Moody's design is visually appealing and easy to read. And by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development, Moody is able to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.
